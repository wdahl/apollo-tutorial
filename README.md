# apollo-tutorial
[Apollos full-stack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/) guides you through building a full-stack, GraphQL-powered app with the Apollo platform.
In this tutorial, you build an interactive app for reserving a seat on an upcoming SpaceX launch. All of the data is accessed through the SpaceX-API.
# System requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8.x or later
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.x or later
* [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.14.1 or later
# Clone the app
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wdahl/apollo-tutorial.git
```
The repository contains two top-level directories: server and client.
# Set up the server
From the server directory, install Apollo Server and the project's other dependencies:
```bash
cd server && npm install
```
# Run the server
run npm start to start your server:
```bash
npm start
```
The Server is now available at http://localhost:4000.
# Set up the client
From the client directory run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
When the build finishes, your browser will open to http://localhost:3000/ automatically.
