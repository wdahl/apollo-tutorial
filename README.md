# Clone the app
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wdahl/apollo-tutorial.git
```
The repository contains two top-level directories: server and client.
# Set up the server
From the server directory, install Apollo Server and the project's other dependencies:
```bash
cd server && npm install
```
# Run the server
run npm start to start your server:
```bash
npm start
```
The Server is now available at http://localhost:4000.
# Set up the client
From the client directory run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
When the build finishes, your browser will open to http://localhost:3000/ automatically.
